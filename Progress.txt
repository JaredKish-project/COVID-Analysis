The two main parts of my project are the GUI and the data processing. My goal was to
have the GUI completed by this time, but it's not, and I will need to work overtime to
catch up. My original plan was to code the GUI myself, from scratch, using the Java Swing 
components. This proved to be too difficult and all of my research recommended using a GUI Builder,
so I installed the NetBeans IDE and have been using it to create my GUI. This has made it much 
easier, but I am still having many issues mainly due to lack of experience with the program. Making 
the GUI is proving to be much harder than I expected and I have allocated significantly more time 
for this project over the next few weeks.
